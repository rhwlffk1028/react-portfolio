  ## Description
  This is my portfolio that was created by using the React technology. When user try to access certain sections through navbar, the page does not reload and take user to the section. React is powerful front-end tool to reflect update and much faster. In this portfolio, you will be able to access my introduction and background as well as the projects I have worked on throughout the bootcamp. Also, I have included my contact information and resume. Feel free to contact me and please enjoy my portfolio!
